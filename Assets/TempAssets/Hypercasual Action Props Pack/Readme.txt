2021, Helix Studio Assets© 
==========================

Thanks for your purchase(s)! :)

All models are set in the prefabs. You will find them in the "Prefabs" folder.
Prefabs are distributed in subfolders according to the shader used. In the package you will find prefabs with paid shader “Stylized Toony Shader” as an example. You can read more about this shaders at the link:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/stylized-toony-shader-161170

Each model is represented by two prefabs (Standard Unity Shader and paid Stylized Toony Shader) with different shaders as an example.
All you need to do is to add the prefab to the scene.

The following shader packages were used for promo materials:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/toony-colors-pro-2-8105

This pack is a continuation and extension of this pack:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/hypercasual-action-props-pack-188456

You can use the texture from the second volume for prefabs of both this and the first volume
In the pack you will find a target prefab for shooting and a separate prefab for the target hit point.
You can use it and use programming to place it at the hit point.
For a machine gun, the barrel is made a separate object that you can rotate using your scripts.
The pivot for the "ParachuteWithParcel" prefab is placed in the center of the parachute, so that the rotation during the fall is more casual.
The "ChainSaw" prefab has no moving parts. This is one solid object.
